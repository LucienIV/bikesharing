This combination of two visualizations shows that the top starting and ending locations are incredibly similar. Though there are various locations throughout the city, the most popular locations for starting and stopping trips are roughly the same.

As can be seen in this visualization, the duration of a given trip peaks around 5 minutes at ~146,000. The number of trips exceeding an hour are in the triple digits and trips exceeding two hours are in the double digits comparatively.

This visualization displays that male users are by far the most frequent across all trip durations. At the peak trip duration the number of male users is more than triple that of female users.

This is a display of the number of trips taken based on the day of the week and time of day. Peak times for trips are 5-7 PM on weekdays, 7-9 AM on weekdays, and 10-5 on weekends. Wednesday only has much fewer users in the 5-7 span than any other day of the work week.

Building on the last visualization, this displays the same information with the additional modification of gender. Males can still be seen to be the most common user accross all given times.

The final visualization is a comparison on day of bike trip against the type of user (customer or subscriber) and gender. Male subscribers are the most common users, followed by female subscribers. Customer levels across genders are relatively constant accross gender.
