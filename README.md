# bikesharing

## Overview

### Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze a bike sharing program set up in New York City to determine feasibility for a similar project in Des Moines.

## Results

### Visualizations and Descriptions

This combination of two visualizations shows that the top starting and ending locations are incredibly similar. Though there are various locations throughout the city, the most popular locations for starting and stopping trips are roughly the same.

As can be seen in this visualization, the duration of a given trip peaks around 5 minutes at ~146,000. The number of trips exceeding an hour are in the triple digits and trips exceeding two hours are in the double digits comparatively.

This visualization displays that male users are by far the most frequent across all trip durations. At the peak trip duration the number of male users is more than triple that of female users.

This is a display of the number of trips taken based on the day of the week and time of day. Peak times for trips are 5-7 PM on weekdays, 7-9 AM on weekdays, and 10-5 on weekends. Wednesday only has much fewer users in the 5-7 span than any other day of the work week.

Building on the last visualization, this displays the same information with the additional modification of gender. Males can still be seen to be the most common user across all given times.

The final visualization is a comparison on day of bike trip against the type of user (customer or subscriber) and gender. Male subscribers are the most common users, followed by female subscribers. Customer levels across genders are relatively constant across gender. 


## Summary

### Summary of Results

The results indicate that a successful bike sharing business should focus on certain criteria to be successful:
-The combination of start/stop location mapping as well as trip duration would indicate that most trips stay within a central area and are between certain locations that are frequented. Based on this, a new startup bike share should focus on the most populated and frequented areas and then branch out to less populous areas once a demand has been proven and capital established.
-The trip durations rarely lasting longer than an hour and peaking around short 5 minute trips would indicate that a potential initial plan would be to set up the first few locations in the city in areas roughly 5-10 minutes apart in areas of major business and residence.
-The prioritization of trips at the start or end of days during the work week would indicate that the prior assessment of setting up locations near business centers would be beneficial to profits and the number of users.
-Based on the obvious gender gap a specialized advertising push towards male users should be made to maximize profit. Additionally, as the majority of users are subscribers, subscribers can be seen to be the primary source of income for the analyzed company. Care should be taken to get users to subscribe to the program, through benefits, promotions, and other methods.

### Further Visualizations

Further visualizations that could be of use to future analysis include:
-A visualization of the population of Des Moines to determine the best areas to set up bike stations.
-A visualization of the number of bikes in use in New York City on a given day to establish an idea of how many bikes would be needed based on the population of a given area.
